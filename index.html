        <p>For 18 years, Pearl was family. In his final years, he lost his voice.</p>
        <div class="pearl-highlight"><p>We wanted to preserve the Pearl who once barked with life. So we placed his throat bone in a clamshell with a four-leaf clover our daughter found and flower petals she picked. Sealed in resin. A portable grave we could carry anywhere.</p></div>
        <p>That's how we developed Audio QR—technology to preserve resonance forever.</p>
        <p><strong>"Resonance opens the way"—this phrase was born from our resonance with Pearl.</strong></p>
        <p>His resonance still opens the way, alongside us. <strong>Pearl Memorial.</strong></p>

# Pearl Memorial presents Soul Carrier
## Returning Ancestors Home

**A Proposal to the Religious Communities of Maui**

---

## Executive Summary

**The Problem:** 180,000 Japanese Americans in Hawaii. Many families lost their connection to Japan 80 years ago, and generations are passing without returning ancestral remains.

**The Solution:** Soul Carrier handles everything—from researching family registries and temple records to personally delivering remains—at no cost to families.

**Why Only We Can Do This:**
- **Japanese-Native Family**: Native Japanese speakers, English proficient; daughter also speaks Japanese
- **Dual Residency**: We chose a life between Maui and Chiba/Miyagi, Japan
- **Expert Knowledge**: Hands-on experience with koseki (family registry), temple records, and bureaucratic processes
- **Family Unit**: The Sato family of three works as one—ensuring trust and continuity
- **Personal Stake**: We committed to becoming guardians of our ancestral grave in Maui. We share this mission as insiders.

**Track Record:** Relationship with Maria Lanakila Church, Martin's case (Japanese American) in progress, network established across Maui.

**Our Ask:** Introduce families in need; support our mobility.

## The Crisis: 80 Years of Separation

Over **180,000 people** of Japanese ancestry live in Hawaii (U.S. Census). Many families lost contact with relatives in Japan during World War II.

**The Urgency:**
- Average age of Issei/Nisei: **85+ years old**
- Estimated **hundreds pass away** each year without returning remains
- Receiving relatives in Japan are also aging—**time is running out on both sides**
- Sansei are now in their 60s-70s—**the last generation** who knows family stories
- Approximately **30%** of Hawaii's Japanese Americans experience some form of ancestral disconnection (community survey est.)

**If we act now, there is still time. If we wait, they will never be delivered.**

---

## The Mission

Soul Carrier bridges this gap—across oceans, generations, and faiths:

- Locate relatives in Japan through family registries
- Navigate bureaucratic and cultural processes
- Physically deliver remains to family temples

**We walk alongside your journey—honoring the wishes you've carried for years.**

---

## Why Interfaith

A Buddhist grandmother may have a Catholic grandson. What matters is not the ritual—**what matters is the reunion.**

**Soul Carrier serves all faiths—because ancestors belong to families, not to any single tradition.**

## The Origin of Pearl Memorial

Pearl was our family dog for 18 years. When he passed in 2025, we brought his ashes to Pearl Harbor—the place that symbolizes the rupture between Japan and America. There, with my wife Mina and daughter Ito, we prayed for peace between families separated by history.

That same year, we discovered my family's ancestral grave exists here in Maui—and the bloodline is on the verge of ending. My wife and I are both second-born children; we are the only household that can serve as guardians for both our families' graves. We made the decision to become the caretakers of the Maui grave, committing to a life between Japan and Hawaii.

**This is not just a project. It is my life's path.**

## Why I Do This: Martin's Story

On December 21, 2025, my daughter developed a high fever. With nowhere to turn, I sought help at a church. There I met Martin (Japanese American).

He said one word: **"Japanese bond."** His mother Teruko was Japanese. She passed 3 years ago; her ashes remain in Hawaii. He wants to return her to family in Gunma Prefecture, but doesn't speak Japanese and doesn't know the process. **I do.**

> "When I met Takuya at church, his daughter had a fever and he was seeking help. I saw how much he cared for his family, and that resonated with me. I decided to help him too. He is the first person who understood what I've been carrying for three years. I trust him with my mother's journey home." — Martin

## Relationship with the Church

In December 2025, Maria Lanakila Catholic Church—**the only church that survived** the 2023 Lahaina wildfire—supported our family's short-term stay. This connection grew from our off-grid support work at nearby farms, and the church graciously helped ensure our family's safety during that time.

Through this experience, we have begun building trust with Maui's religious communities.

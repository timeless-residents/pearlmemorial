<!-- SUMMARY_END -->

## Vision: Regenerating the Entire Island of Maui

In August 2023, the Lahaina wildfire devastated a historic town, claiming over 100 lives.

But Maui carries another "disconnection."

**180,000 Japanese-Americans.** Bonds with Japan severed by World War II, 80 years ago. Remains undelivered, generations fading away.

**Urgency:**
- Average age of Issei/Nisei: **85+**
- Estimated **hundreds die each year** with remains undelivered
- Receiving families in Japan also aging—**time running out on both sides**
- About **30%** of Hawaiian Japanese-Americans experience ancestral disconnection

**If we act now, there's still time. If we wait, they'll never reach home.**

**Soul Carrier** is a project to reconnect these two disconnections.

---

## Why Now

- **2 years since Lahaina fire** — Entering recovery phase
- **Issei/Nisei average age 85+** — No time left
- **Our base is established** — Ready to act
- **Context of Noto Peninsula support** — High interest in disaster recovery

## Why Japanese People Must Act

### The Bond We Severed 80 Years Ago

December 8, 1941. The day of Pearl Harbor, the fate of Japanese-Americans in Hawaii changed forever.

Watched as enemy aliens, forbidden to speak Japanese, hiding Buddhist altars, forced to sever ties with ancestors. **They survived by hiding their Japanese identity.**

Even after the war ended, the disconnection continued. Travel to Japan became difficult, contact with relatives ceased, and with each generation, Japanese language and memories of roots faded.

**This disconnection was created by us, the Japanese.**

### The Chain of Disaster Recovery

2011, Great East Japan Earthquake. Support poured in from around the world.

2023, Lahaina Wildfire. Hawaii's historic town was destroyed.

**Those who received must now give.**

The memory of Japan receiving disaster support is still fresh. Now it's our turn to act.

### The Responsibility to Welcome Our Ancestors Home

Issei and Nisei continued to cherish their ancestors even after leaving Japan. They maintained Buddhist altars, danced Bon Odori, and passed down ancestral names.

**I witnessed this firsthand.**

I participated in Toro Nagashi (lantern floating) in Maui, attended Bon Dance events, and saw Buddhist altars in Japanese-American homes. Even after 80 years, they haven't forgotten their ancestors. Even those who lost Japanese still put their hands together before the altar.

But now, that generation is passing away. Remains stay in Hawaii, undelivered.

**Their ancestors are our ancestors too.**

Japanese-American roots connect to families in Japan. In Gunma, Hiroshima, Okinawa—families are waiting. They just don't know.

### The Path to Peace

Pearl Harbor is a symbol of US-Japan disconnection.

We brought our beloved dog Pearl's remains to that place. To pray for peace for families torn apart by history.

**Delivering remains is reconciliation 80 years in the making.**

Each family reconnected heals one wound of war. This is grassroots peace work that diplomacy cannot achieve.

### No One Else Is Doing This

There is no organization supporting Japanese-American remains repatriation.

Airlines, funeral homes, municipalities—none are addressing this issue. **A social challenge with zero competition.**

If someone doesn't do it, it will be lost forever.

**We chose to be that someone.**

### Why "Now"

**The 80th anniversary of WWII's end—this is the last chance.**

| Fact | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Average age of Issei/Nisei **85+** | Hundreds die each year with remains undelivered |
| Receiving families in Japan also aging | **Time running out on both sides** |
| Fewer Japanese-Americans speak Japanese | Clues to trace roots are disappearing |
| **80th anniversary milestone** | Historic turning point—time for reconciliation |
| Mass passing of baby boomer generation | Memory inheritance crisis peaks |

**5 years is too late. In 10 years, there will be no one to deliver to.**

If we don't act now, Japanese-American roots will be lost forever.

Japanese families won't know. Hawaiian families can't deliver. **No one is at fault, yet no one can connect.**

Japanese who can act at this moment must act.

## Three Pillars

### 1. Soul Carrier — Ancestors to Their Families

Remains repatriation support. From family registry and temple record research to personal delivery. **All denominations welcome.**

**"Ancestors belong to family, not to any particular denomination."**

A Buddhist grandmother might have Catholic grandchildren. What matters isn't the ritual—it's the **reunion**.

|------|---------|
| Target | Japanese-Americans in Hawaii (Maui priority) |
| Goal | 10+ repatriations per year |
| Method | Family registry research, temple records, local visits, personal delivery |
| Cost per case | $5,000 (Research $500, Travel $2,000, Stay $1,000, Ceremony $500, Reserve $1,000) |
| Track Record | Martin's case in progress |

**Service Flow:** ① Hearing (1 week) → ② Japan family research (1-2 months) → ③ Receiving side coordination (1-2 months) → ④ Remains delivery (1-2 weeks) → ⑤ Report submission

**Handling of Remains:** Personal delivery (no shipping or third-party), photo documentation of entire process, 24-hour contact, legal compliance

**Reconnecting 80 years of separation, one family at a time.**

## What the Church Recognized

In December 2025, our daughter developed a high fever while we faced a housing crisis.

At the place we sought help, we met a man named Martin. He said just one thing:

**"Japanese bond."**

His mother was Japanese. Teruko, from Gunma Prefecture. She passed in 2022, and her remains are still in Hawaii. He became our first Soul Carrier case.

> "When I met Takuya at church, his daughter had a fever and he was seeking help. I resonated with his dedication to family and wanted to help him too. He was the first person to understand what I've carried for 3 years. I entrust my mother's return home to him." — Martin

Through Martin, we connected with Maria Lanakila Catholic Church. The only church to survive the 2023 wildfire officially recognized and decided to support our family's disaster recovery activities.

They paid our short-term stay expenses ($885) on our behalf. They signed expense documents. Face to face. Eye to eye. With a handshake.

**The church that survived the fire recognized us.** This fact remains as a signed document.

## DNA and Inscription — Two Axes of Roots

DNA testing tells you "where you came from." Biological lineage.

But "who they were," "what they wished for," "how they lived"—these aren't encoded in genes.

Quartz inscription records **roots as story**.

Names, family crests, proof of life. If DNA connects "blood," inscription connects "soul."

Our quartz inscription technology has durability of **300 million years**.

## Witness: Melanie's Words

### About Hana

Hana is a town of about 2,000 people at Maui's eastern tip, at the end of the winding Hana Highway. One of the birthplaces of the Hawaiian Kingdom and Queen Kaahumanu's birthplace. Home to Piʻilanihale, Hawaii's largest heiau (temple), it's called **"The Real Hawaii."**

Isolated from tourism development, it preserves ancient Hawaiian traditions and cultural practices.

### Who is Melanie

Melanie is a **former principal of a high school in the Hana area**, now running the farm "Hale Pueo (House of Owl)" as an educator.

In a small community, a principal isn't just a school administrator. They're respected as **community intellectuals, leaders, and youth mentors**. She still provides a sanctuary for young people to discover their paths.

The night she read our mission and vision:

> "I was convinced 'there are no coincidences.' Your family validated my work, and gave me the opportunity to advance yours."

> "I feel a small cave and waterfall will be my final resting place on this sacred healing aina (land)."

**For our family too, this is an eternal resting place.**

## Honest Situation

### Why I Chose This Path

I left stable employment to start something no one else was doing.

Our family travels between Maui and Japan, working to deliver Japanese-American remains to their homeland. Bonds severed by war 80 years ago. A job of reconnecting them.

**No one was doing it. So we started.**

### Relationship with Father

In December 2025, my father in Japan offered **conditional continued support**.

Real estate loan coverage continues temporarily. But the condition is to **tone down business activities and get a normal job in Japan**.

In other words, **he'll support us if we give up this path**.

**Let me explain my father's background.**

My father is a former Tokyo metropolitan government employee. He worked in the sewage bureau for **40 years**, including audit roles. Stable income, retirement, pension. That's the path he walked.

He has no entrepreneurial mindset or experience. "Leaving stable employment to bet on an uncertain future" is outside his worldview.

**So I understand his worry.** I think it's an expression of love, not malice.

But that form of love and our path don't align.

### From Blood Relations to Resonance

Conditional support from father. At the same time, support from the church began.

**"Conditional approval"**—this is karma that has continued in my family line.

"I'll approve if you do X." "I won't support unless you do Y." I want to break this pattern of conditional love in my generation.

When blood ties were cut, resonance connected. When the old circuit closed, the new circuit opened.

**We transitioned from a network of blood to a network of resonance.**

Our 5-year-old daughter Ito witnessed this turning point. What she inherits is not the karma of conditional approval, but the story of resonance.

## The First Step

**We have a specific request.**

That alone will get us back to Maui. To those who are waiting.

**Accommodation and local transportation are solved through our local network.**

## Finally

In Maui, there are families torn apart 80 years ago.

Reconnecting them is our path to peace.

**There is an ultimate question.**

300 years ago, records of common people didn't exist. Ordinary people—farmers, craftsmen, merchants—their proof of life disappeared with weathering gravestones. This is the reality we witnessed with our own eyes at Eastern and Western cemeteries in Maui.

**If there were a world where 300-million-year inscriptions became common—**

Everyone would know their ancestors. Where ancestors 500 years ago were born, what they wished for, how they lived. Those records, preserved forever.

**Would people fight in that world?**

If they knew their ancestors were watching. If they knew their descendants would see this choice 500 years later.

**Wouldn't they hold back?**

In a world where eternal connection of souls is realized, people have a reason to stop fighting.

This is our ultimate question.

**"Resonance transcends boundaries."**

Borders, systems, blood ties, karma. Before resonance, boundaries cease to exist.

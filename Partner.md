# Boundarist Movement

**The Final Awakening for the Entire Planet** | 2025.12.18 / Maui, Hawaii

---

## "Resonance opens the way."

To exist. To act. To eternity.

*A Japanese family living off-grid in Maui — survivors of the 2023 fires — helps organizations build disaster resilience while reconnecting Japanese-Americans with their ancestral roots. This isn't consulting. It's partnership born from lived experience.*

---

## What is a Boundarist?

**Someone standing at the boundary.** Someone who has experienced the moment when a system stopped working "as expected." Not an attribute, but a state. Anyone can stand at the boundary someday.

### Two Types

**Outside Boundarist:** Someone pushed out of the system (housing loss, job loss, isolation, etc.) → "It's okay to exist."

**Inside Boundarist:** Someone inside the system who sees its limits and acts on their own judgment → "It's okay to act on your judgment."

### Seven Dependency Systems

Survival (shelter, body) / Social (relationships, family) / Economic (income, credit) / Institutional (visa, credentials) / Information (communication) / Internal (identity) / Temporal (generation)

---

## Why a Movement?

- **Universal question:** "Am I allowed to exist?" — everyone feels this
- **No enemies:** doesn't create division
- **Unstoppable:** decentralized, no organization
- **Born from real experience:** not marketing

### Contagion Model

> Give → Receive → Resonate → Act → Give again

Gold soap labels are the seeds of the movement. Distributed directly to Inside Boundarists.

## Common Across All Industries

Every industry has "Inside Boundarists." People who don't want to just follow the rules. People who want to help the person in front of them. People who feel something is wrong.

**We reach those people: "It's okay to act on your judgment."**

> If it resonates, that's enough. If it doesn't, that's okay too. It just needs to reach those who need it.

## About Fees — Guest Hospitality Model

We operate on **gift economy principles** through a proven legal framework: the **Guest Hospitality Agreement**.

### What This Means

This is a **hospitality arrangement**, NOT consulting or employment. We become your guests, and any contributions we make are:

- Entirely voluntary and self-directed
- An expression of gratitude, not obligation
- Based on mutual respect and shared purpose

### How It Works

| Element | Traditional Consulting | Our Hospitality Model |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Relationship** | Vendor-client | Friends & partners |
| **Obligation** | Contractual deliverables | Voluntary contribution |
| **Compensation** | Hourly/project fees | Gift of hospitality |
| **Duration** | Fixed project term | Flexible, relationship-based |
| **Outcome** | Defined scope | Organic, often exceeds expectations |

### What We Ask For

- **Family-friendly accommodation** for 3 (we move as a unit — non-negotiable)
- Kitchen, laundry, space for our daughter to play
- Access to facilities and relevant teams
- The freedom to contribute as we see fit

### What You Receive

- Our full expertise, initiative, and labor
- Skills honed through disaster conditions
- Documentation and storytelling of your sustainability journey
- A genuine partnership, not a transactional relationship

### Our Track Record

This model has produced remarkable outcomes:

| Partner | Contribution | Result |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| Religious organization | Complete off-grid solar infrastructure | Fully operational temporary housing |
| Permaculture farm | Large-scale property improvements | Sustainable systems still running |
| Historic Hana church | Community integration | Formal accommodation support agreement |

### Legal Framework

Our Guest Hospitality Agreement is designed to:

- Protect both parties legally
- Ensure compliance with applicable laws
- Clarify that this is friendship-based hospitality, not employment
- Allow genuine contribution without work-for-accommodation concerns

### ESTA Constraint & Alternative Arrangements

**Important:** We visit the US on ESTA (Visa Waiver Program). Under ESTA, we cannot receive payment for work performed in the United States. This is why the **Guest Hospitality Model is our primary arrangement** — it's legally compliant hospitality, not employment.

For organizations that require traditional fee structures, the following options are available **for work performed in Japan or through our Japanese entity:**

| Model | Description | Jurisdiction |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Project Fee** | Defined scope with fixed pricing | Japan-based work |
| **Revenue Share** | Success-based compensation | Japanese entity |
| **Hybrid** | Hospitality (US) + fees (Japan work) | Split |

Let's discuss what makes sense for both sides.

# Track Record

**Takuya Sato — Pearl Memorial / Soul Carrier**

---

## Introduction

For over 20 years, I've worked at the intersection of technology and business. Large corporations, startups, global consulting firms. On paper, I looked "successful."

But I learned that what matters most isn't technology—it's seeing the person in front of you.

Now based primarily in Maui, Hawaii, I continue working on [Pearl Memorial / Soul Carrier](https://timeless-residents.github.io/pearlmemorial/)—delivering family memories across borders.

If you're facing challenges in life or business, let's talk first.

## Does This Sound Familiar?

**Business & Work**

| "Everyone's talking about AI—can it actually help my business?" | Let's explore concrete use cases and try something small |
| "I need a website but agencies are expensive" | I'll help you build something you can update yourself |
| "I don't have anyone tech-savvy to bounce ideas off" | I can be that sounding board—tech choices, quote reviews, whatever you need |

**Life & Family**
| Challenge | How I Can Help |
|-----------|----------------|
| "I want to digitize and preserve my parents' photos and letters" | Let's figure out the best way to organize and store them |
| "I want backup power and connectivity for emergencies" | Solar, batteries, Starlink—I'll share what I've learned hands-on |

**Learning & New Ventures**
| Challenge | How I Can Help |
|-----------|----------------|
| "I want to learn programming but don't know where to start" | Let's pick the right language and materials for your goals |
| "I want to build an app or service as a side project" | From idea refinement to building something minimal that works |
| "I struggle with technical documentation in English" | Reading strategies and AI-powered learning methods |

## How Consultations Work

```
1. Send me an email: "I'm struggling with this..."
2. We'll chat online for about 30 minutes (free)
3. If I can help, I'll propose next steps and costs
4. Pay when we achieve results (results-based fee)
```

**Feel free to reach out.** Even if you're thinking "is this too small to ask?"—that's fine.

## Why Me?

### Boundarist — The Power to Cross Boundaries

I see boundaries not as limitations, but as starting points for creation.

Technology and culture, strategy and creativity, Japan and America—I believe new possibilities emerge where different domains intersect.

| Capital | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Knowledge Capital** | Experience spanning from COBOL to AI |
| **Relationship Capital** | Networks connecting Japan, US, and Asia-Pacific |
| **Creative Capital** | Ability to design solutions beyond existing categories |

By combining these three, "belonging nowhere" became my strength.

**Boundaries are not walls—they are doors.**

## Before We Start

Thank you for reading this far. If you're still hesitating, here are some things I often hear.

**"I'm worried about how much it might cost..."**
The first 30 minutes are free. After that, you only pay when we achieve results—so feel free to reach out.

**"I'm not very tech-savvy..."**
I don't use jargon. If something's unclear, ask me as many times as you need.

**"You seem busy..."**
I try to reply within 24 hours. Time zones aren't a problem.

Often, once you take that first step, it becomes "I'm glad I asked."

---

**"Is my problem too small to ask about..."**
Smaller problems are often easier to solve. I genuinely welcome them.

**"I'm not sure I'm at a level worth your time..."**
Whatever level you're at, we can start from where you are.

If you're struggling, that's reason enough.

---

**"I'm afraid of getting a hard sell..."**
If it's not a fit, just say no. That won't end our relationship.

**"Will it just be sales talk..."**
I start by listening, not selling.

Here, we go at your pace.

---

**"With your big consulting background, won't you talk down to me..."**
I care more about the person in front of me than titles. My approach is to think alongside you.

**"I'm worried an expert will make me feel stupid..."**
I don't say things like "you don't know that?"

Let's talk as equals.

---

## Fees

- **Business Support**: Results-based. First 30 minutes free.
- **Soul Carrier Support**: Always welcome. See the [proposal](https://timeless-residents.github.io/pearlmemorial/proposal_generic_en.pdf) for details.

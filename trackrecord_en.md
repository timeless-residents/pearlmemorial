## Introduction

For over 20 years, I've worked at the intersection of technology and business. Large corporations, startups, global consulting firms. On paper, I looked "successful."

But I learned that what matters most isn't technology—it's seeing the person in front of you.

If you're facing challenges in life or business, let's talk first.

## Does This Sound Familiar?

**Business & Work**
| Challenge | How I Can Help |
|-----------|----------------|
| "I want to move beyond paper and Excel, but where do I start?" | Let's map your workflow together and find the simplest path to digitize |
| "Everyone's talking about AI—can it actually help my business?" | Let's explore concrete use cases and try something small |
| "I need a website but agencies are expensive" | I'll help you build something you can update yourself |
| "I don't have anyone tech-savvy to bounce ideas off" | I can be that sounding board—tech choices, quote reviews, whatever you need |

**Life & Family**
| Challenge | How I Can Help |
|-----------|----------------|
| "I want to digitize and preserve my parents' photos and letters" | Let's figure out the best way to organize and store them |
| "I want backup power and connectivity for emergencies" | Solar, batteries, Starlink—I'll share what I've learned hands-on |
| "I want to communicate with family overseas but the language barrier..." | From translation tools to actual bridging help |

**Learning & New Ventures**
| Challenge | How I Can Help |
|-----------|----------------|
| "I want to learn programming but don't know where to start" | Let's pick the right language and materials for your goals |
| "I want to build an app or service as a side project" | From idea refinement to building something minimal that works |
| "I struggle with technical documentation in English" | Reading strategies and AI-powered learning methods |

## How Consultations Work

```
1. Send me an email: "I'm struggling with this..."
2. We'll chat online for about 30 minutes (free)
3. If I can help, I'll propose next steps and costs
4. Pay when we achieve results (results-based fee)
```

**Feel free to reach out.** Even if you're thinking "is this too small to ask?"—that's fine.

---

## Common Concerns

**"I'm worried about costs"**
First 30 minutes are free. After that, pay only when we achieve results.

**"I'm not tech-savvy..."**
I speak without jargon. Ask me anything, as many times as you need.

**"Are you too busy to respond?"**
I reply within 24 hours, even across time zones.

Not knowing can feel unsettling. But once you reach out, it becomes "I'm glad I asked."

**"Is my problem too small to ask about?"**
Smaller problems are easier to solve. I welcome them.

**"Am I at a level worth your time?"**
Whatever level you're at, we start from where you are.

You might be thinking "someone like me..." But if you're struggling, that's reason enough.

**"Will I get a hard sell?"**
If it's not a fit, just say no. That won't end our relationship.

**"Will it be all sales talk?"**
I listen first, before anything else.

You may have had bad experiences before. Here, we go at your pace.

**"Big consulting background—will you talk down to me?"**
Titles don't matter. I'm here to think alongside you.

**"Will an expert make me feel stupid?"**
There's no "you don't know that?" here.

If you've been looked down on before, all the more reason. Let's talk as equals.

# Track Record

**Takuya Sato — Pearl Memorial / Soul Carrier**

---

## Introduction

Soul Carrier is an extension of my career.

For over 20 years, I've worked at the intersection of technology and business. Large corporations, startups, global consulting firms. On paper, I looked "successful."

But I learned that what matters most isn't technology—it's seeing the person in front of you.

If you're facing challenges in life or business, let's talk first. If I can help, I'll work on a results-based fee.

### How Consultations Work

```
1. Send me an email: "I'm struggling with this..."
2. We'll chat online for about 30 minutes (free)
3. If I can help, I'll propose next steps and costs
4. Pay when we achieve results (results-based fee)
```

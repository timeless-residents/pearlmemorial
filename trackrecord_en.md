**Takuya Sato — Pearl Memorial / Soul Carrier**

## Introduction

Soul Carrier is an extension of my career.

For over 20 years, I've worked at the intersection of technology and business. Large corporations, startups, global consulting firms. On paper, I looked "successful."

But I learned that what matters most isn't technology—it's seeing the person in front of you.

If you're facing challenges in life or business, let's talk first. If I can help, I'll work on a results-based fee.

                        <p>After long days of caregiving, mind and body are depleted. Even remembering is painful — that's completely understandable. But what TokiStorage engraves isn't a record of illness or caregiving. It's the times they smiled, the things they cherished, the proof they lived. No subscriptions, no maintenance. Once made, nothing more is needed. Precisely because you can't sort through your feelings right now, the choice to "just preserve it for now" may quietly become a source of strength someday.</p>
                        <p class="persona-result">No energy to maintain anything? That's okay. A quiet proof of existence, complete in a single moment</p>

            <h3>Shikinen Sengu — Record succession every 20 years</h3>
            <p>At Ise Grand Shrine, the sanctuary is rebuilt every 20 years, passing down technique and spirit to the next generation. TokiStorage adopts the same philosophy. <strong>Every 20 years, data is migrated to the latest storage medium in our own "Shikinen Sengu"</strong>, aiming to deliver records a thousand years into the future. Beyond the physical durability of quartz glass, the human act of technological succession strengthens the permanence of records.</p>

            <p>Not a famous tourist destination — why Sado?</p>
            <p>The &#x221E;-shaped island resembles Maui. Once a place of exile where nameless people lived, its World Heritage gold mines were sustained by anonymous miners. But Sado has another face. Noh theater, brought by nobles and intellectuals exiled from the capital, has taken root on the island for over 600 years and is still performed at village shrines to this day.</p>
            <p>Not "a place that is remembered," but "a place where the memories of forgotten people endured." That is why we chose Sado. We ourselves are relocating to Sado in spring 2026, putting down roots in this land.</p>
            <p>Creating your proof of existence with your own hands, in a land that has carried memories across time — that act itself becomes the first page of a thousand-year story.</p>

            <p>It all began with one dog.</p>
            <p>Pearl, a beloved family dog since 2007. After she passed in 2025, I placed her throat bone in a clam shell, added a four-leaf clover I had picked and a petal my daughter had found, and sealed it in epoxy resin to create a "portable grave." — That was the origin of "proof of existence."</p>

            <p>Our first destination was Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. With Pearl's grave and our family, we pledged love and peace. During that journey, we discovered that our family's ancestral grave still exists on Maui. As a couple — both second-born children — we decided to spend half the year on Maui as grave keepers.</p>

            <p>On Maui, we visited every major temple and church, examining Eastern and Western gravestones with our own eyes. That's where we encountered the "Unknown" — forgotten graves of Japanese immigrants in Lahaina. We began the work of repatriating remains. In Gunma Prefecture, we surveyed 5,000 gravestones on foot. We met Martin, a Japanese-American who had been unable to bring his mother's remains home to Japan for three years. We are currently assisting with the interment at a family grave in Japan.</p>
            <p>Not just "reclaiming forgotten existences," but<br>"building a system so no one is forgotten in the first place."</p>
            <p>The foundation for this conviction was cultivated in an unexpected place. Urayasu, Chiba Prefecture — the city that experienced soil liquefaction in the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. After catastrophic damage, a new district was built with hope of permanence, engineered with advanced countermeasures. The homeowners' association uniting the detached houses of Quon Garden Shin-Urayasu and the condominiums of Quon Shin-Urayasu — "Timeless Town Shin-Urayasu." In this community bearing the name "Timeless," I served as association president for two years. Supporting the lives of approximately 300 households, creating a place that would be lived in across generations. Precisely because this land had once lost everything to disaster, the conviction was born that "records" and "succession" must be protected by systems.</p>
            <p>Managing a community, surveying gravestones, working tirelessly for the repatriation of remains — when everything connected in a single line, TokiStorage was born.</p>
            <p class="philosophy-mission">Challenging the inequality of memory — that is TokiStorage's mission.</p>

            <p>What remains is <strong>what you believed, who you loved, and how you lived</strong>.</p>
            <p>TokiStorage is a preservation tool, but its true value lies in the process of "writing." When you imagine a thousand years ahead, you begin to reexamine how you live today. — Perhaps that transformation is the greatest gift of all.</p>

                    <p>Quartz glass (silicon dioxide) is one of the most stable substances on Earth. Joint research by Hitachi and Kyoto University demonstrated that laser recording on quartz glass can preserve data for "over 300 million years." 1,000 years is a theoretical value based on the material's scientific properties. QR codes have over 30 years of proven reliability since their development in 1994 and are backed by ISO international standards ensuring backward compatibility.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>QR codes are certified as an international standard (ISO/IEC 18004), making it unlikely the standard itself would disappear. Even if QR code readers ceased to exist, the technology to read information from black-and-white patterns is fundamental and entirely decodable with future technology. Additionally, TokiStorage offers the option of engraving information in human-readable text alongside the QR code.</p>

                    <p>Quartz glass is extremely hard and will not break under normal handling. However, strong impacts can cause breakage.

                    <p>Yes. Our online course supports international shipping. Consultation, content finalization, and payment are all completed online, with worldwide delivery via EMS or equivalent. Since quartz glass is a physical medium that needs no server and knows no borders, you can scan it with your smartphone anywhere in the world. Contact us for details.</p>

Start with a 30-minute online briefing where we'll share case studies and partnership terms. Feel free to reach out.</p>

                    <p>TokiStorage's greatest strength is being a physical medium that requires no server, no app, and no electricity. Records engraved in quartz glass continue to exist regardless of our company's business continuity. As long as you have a smartphone camera, you can read the QR code — our company's existence has no bearing on your ability to access your records. We also provide production data to customers and recommend distributed storage of replicas. The very reason we chose quartz glass is "permanence that doesn't depend on any system." Additionally, our founder is personally relocating to Sado Island in spring 2026, committed to dedicating his life to this work.</p>

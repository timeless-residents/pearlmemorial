            AI accelerated management. But it also shortened its sight.<br>
            The people who were supposed to see beyond the frame<br>
            have quietly locked their gaze inside the quarter.

        <div class="core-message">
            <strong>Core argument:</strong> AI was meant to free the human gaze — to let us see further and wider. In practice, it has compressed management's time horizon and eroded the original role of advisors and consultants: to see beyond the frame. The essence of perspective is which time horizon you stand on when you look at the world.
        </div>

        <p class="disclaimer">This essay does not refer to any specific firm or individual. It is a structural reflection on the relationship between management and technology.</p>

        <h2>1. What happened in a meeting room</h2>

        <p>I sat across from a person who leads the AI division of a major consulting firm. The meeting was supposed to last 30 minutes.</p>

        <p>I talked about a business that engraves proof of human existence into quartz glass. Physical records that last 1,000 years. A design that depends on no server. The formative experience of visiting 5,000 unclaimed graves.</p>

        <p>For the first 15 minutes, they listened as if this were an extension of their usual AI engagements. Then something shifted behind their eyes.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"That's terrifying. I like it."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>What was "terrifying"? It was not the business in front of them. What they saw was the narrowness of their own field of vision. Every day, they work at the frontier of AI, lead teams of hundreds, manage engagements worth tens of millions. Yet all of it — every decision, every metric, every deliverable — fits within a 6-month sprint and a quarterly KPI cycle.</p>

        <p>A person carrying a 1,000-year time horizon had just sat down across the table. In that instant, the "frame" around their world became visible. That was what terrified them.</p>

        <h2>2. What AI brought to the management gaze</h2>

        <h3>Acceleration and compression</h3>

        <p>The greatest change AI brought to management is the acceleration of decision-making. Data is analyzed instantly. Predictive models see one quarter ahead. Automation cuts headcount. This is, in itself, a valid evolution.</p>

        <p>But acceleration has a side effect. When you can spin faster, spinning becomes the goal.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Six-month sprints become three months, then six weeks</li>
            <li>KPIs converge on "this quarter's numbers," and no one speaks of "the shape of the company in ten years"</li>
            <li>"Efficiency" becomes synonymous with "strategy"</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In Kahneman's (2011) terms, management decision-making is skewing toward System 1 (fast, intuitive) while System 2 (slow, deliberate, long-range) atrophies. AI has supercharged System 1 but is pushing the humans who served System 2 out of the market.</p>

        <h3>How "short-term" gets disguised as "rational"</h3>

        <p>The deeper problem is that this compression is accepted not as irrational but as rational. Every answer AI produces is based on "data that exists now." That data reflects the past and the present, but it does not contain "a future that does not yet exist."</p>

        <p>As a result, AI-informed decisions are structurally optimized for extensions of the present. Clayton Christensen's (1997) "Innovator's Dilemma" — the failure to see new value that existing metrics cannot measure — is accelerating, not diminishing, in the AI era.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Being rational and being right are different things. Rationality only functions within an existing framework."</p>
            <cite>— Herbert Simon, <em>Administrative Behavior</em> (1947)</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>3. The perspective advisors were meant to hold</h2>

        <p>Management advisors, consultants, strategic counselors — why do these roles exist at all? The answer: to see what the executive, from inside the organization, cannot. To see beyond the frame.</p>

        <p>Peter Drucker (1954) defined the consultant's value as "asking the questions that cannot be seen from inside the organization." The critical word is not "answers" but "questions." And the most important questions always transcend the current time horizon.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>"Will this business exist in 10 years?"</li>
            <li>"How will this decision affect the next generation?"</li>
            <li>"What structural shift is invisible right now?"</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Today, AI is "replacing" this role. Data analysis, market research, competitive benchmarking — AI handles the "means" at high speed. The result: consulting itself is being reduced to "delivery of means," and the essence — "delivery of perspective" — is disappearing.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>The essence of consulting is not producing answers. It is directing the executive's gaze toward a time horizon they have not yet considered. When AI replaces this role, "long-term" vanishes from the management field of vision.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>4. What happens when the time horizon disappears</h2>

        <h3>Corporate time horizons</h3>

        <p>The average lifespan of a Japanese company is 23.3 years (Tokyo Shoko Research, 2023). Yet over 33,000 Japanese firms have survived more than 100 years. The difference is not technology or capital — it is time-horizon design.</p>

        <p>What century-old firms share is a question at the center of their management: not "What are this quarter's numbers?" but "What do we pass to the next generation?" A Kyoto confectioner who thinks about "the flavor 30 years from now" while preparing today's batch operates from a structurally different decision framework.</p>

        <h3>The time horizon of memory</h3>

        <p>Personal memory obeys the same structure. The average cloud service lifespan is 10–15 years. 99% of social media posts go unaccessed after 5 years. Digital is an extraordinary tool optimized for "now," but it is not designed to endure for 100 years.</p>

        <p>When the AI leader said "terrifying," it was because this structure became suddenly visible. The tool they work with every day — AI — only functions in the direction of compressing time. And at the center of that compression sat they themselves.</p>

        <h2>5. Shifting perspective — can AI become a tool of liberation?</h2>

        <p>The real question is: how was AI supposed to be used?</p>

        <p>If AI handles day-to-day analysis, prediction, and automation, then humans should be free to look further. If AI manages this quarter's numbers, executives can think about the next decade. If AI runs market analysis, consultants can look outside the market entirely.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Technology is a tool for allowing humans to focus on what they should actually be doing. And what they should be doing is asking questions no one has asked yet."</p>
            <cite>— Alan Kay</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>But reality has gone the other way. AI spins the short-term cycle faster, and humans get caught in the spin. We are being used by the tool.</p>

        <h3>Inside the frame and beyond it</h3>

        <p>The essence of perspective is where you stand.</p>

        <p>From inside the frame, AI is an efficiency tool — a way to run sprints faster, cut costs, optimize KPIs. This view is correct. But if it is the only thing you see, then your perspective itself is trapped inside the frame.</p>

        <p>From outside the frame, AI becomes a tool for expanding the human field of vision. Moving freely between "this quarter's numbers" and "the world 100 years from now." That is what true breadth of perspective looks like.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>As long as AI is used only as an efficiency tool, management's field of vision will keep narrowing. When AI is reframed as a tool for expanding vision — when the short-term is delegated to AI and humans reclaim the long view — technology finally liberates the human gaze.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>6. The view from a 1,000-year time horizon</h2>

        <p>A person who has walked among 5,000 unclaimed graves sees a different landscape.</p>

        <p>Names carved into stone are dissolving in acid rain. No one is left to pay maintenance fees. Municipal authorities are sending demolition notices. Stones erected 100 years ago with the wish of "eternity" are about to vanish under institutional and environmental change.</p>

        <p>From this landscape, a question forms: "What would a record designed to last 1,000 years actually look like?" No server dependency. No maintenance fees. Readable without electricity. Functional regardless of institutional change. Working backward from this question led to quartz glass engraving.</p>

        <p>This is not a story about technology. It is a story about perspective.</p>

        <p>From inside a 6-month sprint, this question never arises. From inside a quarterly KPI cycle, "What endures for 1,000 years?" does not register as a valid question. That is what happens when perspective is locked inside the frame.</p>

        <p>The person who said "terrifying" in that meeting room was, in fact, exceptional. They noticed the narrowness of their own gaze. Most people don't. They keep spinning with AI, never noticing the frame around them.</p>

        <h2>7. Perspective is a choice</h2>

        <p>Perspective is not talent. It is a choice.</p>

        <p>Where you stand is up to you. You can stand on the quarter. On the decade. On the century. On the millennium. And that choice changes everything you see.</p>

        <p>If AI is narrowing management's gaze, it is not AI's fault. It is the fault of humans who decided to use AI only inside the frame.</p>

        <p>If consultants are being reduced to delivery machines, it is not AI's fault. It is the fault of organizations that decided selling means is more profitable than offering perspective.</p>

        <p>And if memory is disappearing, it is not the fault of digital. It is the fault of a design philosophy that looked only at "present convenience" and never asked about a thousand years from now.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"The truly important questions are always outside the time horizon."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>If management's field of vision is shrinking, it is simply because no one chose to look further. AI is accelerating that choice, not forcing it. The choice itself remains — right now, in this moment — in your hands.</p>

### Beyond Boundaries, to Eternity

To exist. To act. To eternal.

**Your story matters.**

Laser-engraved keepsakes to preserve your memories.

---

## Standing at the Boundary?

**You're not alone. We've been there too.**

A **Boundarist** is someone standing at the boundary — someone who has experienced the moment when systems stop working as they "should."

Whether you're outside the system or seeing its limits from within.

| If you're... | The message for you |
|---|---|
| **Outside** (system failed you) | "It's okay to exist." |
| **Inside** (seeing limits, wanting to act) | "You can act on your own judgment." |
| **Everyone** | "Your story matters." |

## The 7 Systems We Depend On

Standing at the boundary = when these systems shake:

| System | What we depend on | When it shakes |
|---|---|---|
| **Survival** | Body, housing, energy | Illness, homelessness, power outage |
| **Social** | Family, partner, community | Bereavement, divorce, isolation |
| **Economic** | Income, assets, credit | Job loss, bankruptcy, layoffs |
| **Institutional** | Nationality, visa, qualifications | Entry denied, license revoked |
| **Information** | Communication, access | No signal, censorship |
| **Inner** | Identity, meaning, spirit | "Who am I?", burnout |
| **Temporal** | Life stage, generation | Feeling outdated, generation gap |

## Timeless Eternal Hope — Four Pillars

Pearl Memorial is part of **Timeless Eternal Hope**, built on four pillars:

| Pillar | What it means | How we do it |
|---|---|---|
| 🕊 **Carry** | Soul Carrier | We carry souls home |
| 🔥 **Inscribe** | Proof of existence | Laser engraving preserves memories |
| 🛡 **Preserve** | Disaster-resistant memory | Quartz glass, QR archives |
| ⚡ **Sustain** | Digital independence | Your own micro datacenter for eternal preservation |

---

## Soul Carrier — Reuniting Roots

**We carry souls home.**

People crossed the ocean. For different reasons, in different eras. Over the years, connections to their homeland faded.

### We help deliver:

- **Ashes to ancestral homes** — Return remains to family graves in Japan
- **Families to their roots** — Reconnect with relatives, registries, and history
- **Family crests to memory** — Research your kamon with English report on its history and significance
- **Stories to completion** — Close the circle that distance left open

> "Loss doesn't have to be the end."

### Why existing services struggle

It's not anyone's fault. But there are walls.

| Wall | Reality |
|---|---|
| Language | City halls and temples rarely offer English support |
| Systems | Family registries and cemetery procedures require a Japanese address |
| Continuity | No one handles research, coordination, and accompaniment as one journey |
| Heart | Few treat this as "completing a story" rather than "processing paperwork" |

We stand on both sides of these walls.

### Why Us?

**We stand at the boundary ourselves.**

| What we offer | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Japanese natives living between Hawaii and Japan | We understand both worlds |
| Fluent in both languages and cultures | No translation barriers |
| We have homes in Japan ready to welcome you | Stay with family, not hotels |
| We know the systems: family registries, temples, cemeteries | We navigate the bureaucracy for you |
| We've experienced loss — Pearl (2007-2025) led us here | We understand grief firsthand |

Pearl was family for 18 years. After creating a portable grave for him, we visited Pearl Harbor as a family. With his remains, we prayed for peace. 80 years after the war — times have changed, but the wish for peace transcends generations. This experience awakened our family's mission.

**We don't just research. We walk with you. We carry your story home.**

### Pricing

| Service | Price | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Consultation | Free | 30-minute call to understand your situation |
| Research | $500 | Locate family records, graves, contacts, and kamon |
| Coordination | $1,000 | Arrange ceremonies, temple visits, and logistics |
| Accompaniment / Proxy | $2,000+ | We travel with you — or on your behalf (+ travel expenses) |
